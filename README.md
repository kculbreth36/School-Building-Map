School-Building-Map

About the Project

The School-Building-Map is a Java application that helps users navigate through a complex school layout using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between locations. The application models the school's halls and rooms as nodes in a graph, allowing users to input their current location and desired destination to receive step-by-step navigation instructions.

Features

Dynamic Pathfinding: Utilizes Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to find the quickest route between two points in the school.
Interactive User Input: Users can specify start and end points dynamically through the console.
Scalable Map Model: Easily modifiable node and hall structure to represent different or expanded school layouts.
Getting Started

Prerequisites
Java SE Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. The project is compatible with JDK 8 and above.
Basic understanding of command line operations for compiling and running Java applications.
